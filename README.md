# PREPARING-FOR-INFLUENZA-SEASON
: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from  the flu. the objective is to determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on providing data-driven insights for a medical staffing agency to prepare for the upcoming US influenza season. The primary objective was to determine the timing and quantity of temporary staff needed for hospitals across all 50 states by identifying high-risk populations and regional trends.

## Key Findings
1. The analysis utilized decades of mortality data from the US Census/NCHS and weekly lab results from the CDC.


2. Vulnerable Populations: Statistical testing confirmed that individuals aged 75 and older have a significantly higher probability of flu-related mortality compared to younger age groups.


3. Secondary Risk Group: Children aged 0-5 years also show an increased mortality rate compared to other age groups under 75.


4. Population Correlation: There is a moderate correlation (0.48) between a state’s total population and the number of flu-related deaths, indicating that larger populations generally face higher death counts.


5. Data Distribution: The mortality data sample is left-skewed, with values concentrated on the higher end of the scale, indicating a high concentration of cases in specific high-impact categories.

## Recommendations
1. To optimize medical personnel allocation, the following strategies are proposed:


2. Prioritize Elderly Communities: Focus staffing and resources on communities with high populations of residents aged 75+.


3. National Staffing Plan: Implement a geographic allocation plan specifying the timing and location of medical personnel across the U.S..


4. Investigate Success Factors: Research states with lower-than-average death rates to identify effective medical services or health cultures that can be replicated.


5. Seasonality Assessment: Determine if influenza timing is consistent across states to refine when staff should be deployed.

## Tools & Data Sources
